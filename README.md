## Development Server

Run `yarn install && yarn start` & Navigate to http://localhost:4200/

To allow access on other browser devices, over the same network, You can set host to `0.0.0.0`/IP address of the development machine. You can also set a different web port, default port is 4200.

`yarn install && yarn start --host 0.0.0.0 --port <PORT>`

`http://<IP OF HOST MACHINE>:<PORT>/`

> The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Production Build & Deployment

Run `./build --clean-start` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

To deploy on another machine, You shall need to copy build artifacts stored in the `dist/` directory (and, you may want to use provided `nginx.conf`; to avoid changes in default nginx config).

> Make sure you have nginx(-light) installed on the deployment machine.

### Starting with nginx

start: `nginx -c nginx.conf -p $(pwd)`

stop: `nginx -s stop`

> nginx `-s stop` terminates the nginx process immediately while `-s quit` does a graceful shutdown.

For **windows**, see details [here](docs/windows-nginx-deployment-guide.md)

> Make sure to fix `include` directive and `server root` in `nginx.conf`; unless you want to use default.
